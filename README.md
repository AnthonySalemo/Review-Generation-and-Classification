This project aims to model IMDB movie reviews. Movies are initially pulled from Stanford IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset found here: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
Further metadata enhancement is done using the IMDB Non-Commercial Datasets.
The reviews are compiled using: Data Extraction.R and Genre Mapping.R  
The compiled data is used to make generative models: nGram Generation Exploration, nGram_Generation, GRU Generation, and GPT2 Generation.  
Classification models are made to differentiate real reviews vs generated reviews with: nGram Classification Exploration, Review_Classification_Baseline, Review_Classification.
