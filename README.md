This project aims to model IMDB movie reviews. Movies are initially pulled from Stanford IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset found here: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ 
The reviews are compiled using: Data Extraction.R and Genre Mapping.R
The compiled data is used to make generative models: [N-Gram], GRU Generation, and GPT2 Generation
Classification models are made to differentiate real reviews vs generated reviews with: Review_Classification and Review_Classification_Baseline
